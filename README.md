This contains a .vbs file with code that creates a summary table of stock data, including ticker symbol, yearly change from opening to closing, the percent change from opening to closing, and total stock volume. Yearly changes are formatted in red if negative and formatted in green if positive. Additionally, this code creates a second summary table that displays the greatest % increase, greatest % decrease, and greatest total stock volume for each year. The code is written to loop through each year's worksheet by running it once. This satisfies both the general and bonus assignment requirements.
